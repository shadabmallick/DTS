    <string name="aboutustxt">In describing the American identity,Huntington first contests the notion that the country is, as often repeated, "a nation of immigrants". He writes that America\'s founders were not immigrants, but settlers, since British settlers came to North America to establish a new society, as opposed to migrating from one existing society to another one as immigrants do. Later peoples who joined the culture present in the original British colonies, already established by these settlers, were indeed immigrants. Would America be the America it is today if in the 17th and 18th centuries it had been settled not by British Protestants but by French, Spanish, or Portuguese Catholics? The answer is no. It would not be America; it would be Quebec, Mexico, or Brazil. Protestant emphasis on the individual conscience and the responsibility of individuals to learn God truths directly from the Bible promoted American commitment to individualism.</string>
